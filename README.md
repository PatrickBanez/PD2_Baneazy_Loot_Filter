# PD2_Baneazy_Loot_Filter
Loot filter code for Project Diablo 2

This is my personal loot filter for PD2. It should be a great filter from beginning to end game. It is more tailored for end game but it's usuable for early/mid game as well.
Each line is commented on what it's function is which makes this filter easy to understand/edit. I will be adding more to this filter such as special names for items such as +3
javazon skill with 20 increased attack speed gloves. There are some items like that in the filter already though. If you have any suggestions on what can be added/changed 
please let me know.
