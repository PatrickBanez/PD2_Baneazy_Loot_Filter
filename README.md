# PD2 Baneazy Loot Filter
Loot filter code for Project Diablo 2

This is my personal loot filter for PD2. It should be a great filter from beginning to end game. It is more tailored for end game but it's usuable for early/mid game as well.
Each line is commented on what it's function is which makes this filter easy to understand/edit. I will be adding more to this filter such as special names for items such as +3
javazon skill with 20 increased attack speed gloves. There are some items like that in the filter already though. If you have any suggestions on what can be added/changed 
please let me know. 

Overview:

This filter shows everything in Normal difficulty, then tapers off items as the difficulty increases. Normal tier items dont show after Normal difficulty and exceptional tier items don't show after Nightmare Difficulty. Hell difficulty is the most restrictive, since that is where most people will be spending their time. Only items worth keeping in Hell will be shown. Whether this is for crafting, trading, making runewords, or just selling for gold, these are the items that I felt were the only ones worth showing. If you are looking for any item that doesn't show in hell, like an exceptional base, you can always farm nightmare or normal for it. Charms are renamed to either GC, LC, or SC (grand charm, large charm, or small charm) after identification. If these charms have any valuable mod, a prefix will be added to the identified name (i.e. FHR GC or Life Light GC). Jewels will also be renamed in the same way, except identified jewels will just be called jewel. All sets and uniques will show, but only the GG items will get a special notification box. Items will have marks on the map according to their value, with GG items having a large red dot on the map. If there is anything I missed or anything you think I should add let me know.
