# PD2 Baneazy Loot Filter
Loot filter code for Project Diablo 2

This is my personal loot filter for PD2. It should be a great filter from beginning to end game. It is more tailored for end game but it's usuable for early/mid game as well.
Each line is commented on what it's function is which makes this filter easy to understand/edit. I will be adding more to this filter such as special names for items such as +3
javazon skill with 20 increased attack speed gloves. There are some items like that in the filter already though. If you have any suggestions on what can be added/changed 
please let me know.

V2.1 added standard of heroes for cubing, cartographer's orb, horadrim scarab, and updated maps/dungeon.

V2.2 fixed puzzle box for drop notification/pick up box, enabled magic orbs and wands for crafting, added caster notes for magic wands and orbs
     added 0 socket and 3os claw bases w/ Weapon block.
     
V2.2a added magic bows for crafting. Short battle bow, short siege bow, diamond bow, long battle bow, large siege bow, crusader bow, long war bow, gothic bow, and hydra bow.
     Added crafting recipe for safety bows.
